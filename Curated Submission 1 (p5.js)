Curated Submission 1 (p5.js)
For this curated submission it is from week 2 ph.js where we were learning how to code basic javascript and interations with a mouse. 
I choose this code because it is where I finally understood that coding is more than for just tech purposes in life but it can be used to make art and express yourself. 
I tried to make a dog face as I really missed my dog back home and I also thought it would be something quite simple for me to begin coding with.
